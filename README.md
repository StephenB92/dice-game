# Dice Game

## Project Overview

The Dice Game is a simple yet fun game for two players. Roll the dice to add to your score - the first player to reach 100 points wins!! Be wary though, if you roll a one you will lose all of your current points. To avoid this, press the bank button to save your current points and pass the game to the next player.
