# Dice Game

## Project Overview

The Dice Game is a simple yet fun game for two players. Roll the dice to add to your score - the first player to reach 100 points wins!! Be wary though, if you roll a one you will lose all of your current points. To avoid this, press the bank button to save your current points and pass the game to the next player.

### Code
- Credit to Jonas Schmedmann and the Udemy course [The Complete Javascript Course 2022: 
From Zero to Expert, Modal Window Section](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22648433#questions) for the code used to create and style the "rules" modal window. As the project being created was also inspired by another module on this project, the separate modal window section was a good fit for the intended project and the inclusion of the feature to display the rules to the players without needlessly cluttering the main game page.
