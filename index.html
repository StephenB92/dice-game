            <p>Welcome to Dice Game!! The Dice Game is a simple yet fun game for two players.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Roll the dice to add to your score - the first player to reach 100 points wins!! Be wary though, if you
                roll a one you will lose all of your current points. To avoid this, press the bank button to save your
                current points and pass the game to the next player.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Player 1 will start the game.</li>
                <li>Click the "Roll Dice" button to add to your score.</li>
                <li>You can roll the dice as many times as you wish until you click the "Bank" button OR roll a 1.</li>
                <li>Click the "Bank" button to add your current points to your total score and pass control to the other
                    player.</li>
                <li>If you roll a 1, you will lose all points that have not been banked and control will switch to
                    the
                    other player.</li>
                <li>First player to bank 100 total points wins!!</li>
            </ol>
